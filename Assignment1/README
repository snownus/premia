This directory contains the files
x_train.csv
y_train.csv
x_test.csv
y_test.csv

x_train.csv consist of 14 columns each entries of +1 and -1
y_train.csv contains the label for the bit patterns in x_train.csv

Write a MLP code to find that function that maps the data
x_train.csv to y_train.csv.

Evaluate your results on x_test.csv and y_test.csv

Make the networks:
14 -> 100 -> 40 -> 4
14 -> 28x6 -> 4
14 -> 14x28 -> 4

Try experimenting with deeper networks when you have time.
