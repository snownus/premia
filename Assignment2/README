make a MLP to grade MNIST data set

(1) you need to try your own network architecture, some suggestions are:

input -> 10 x n -> 10
input -> 100 x n -> 10
input -> 1000 x n -> 10

(2) try different optimisers from : https://keras.io/optimizers/
and try different parameters for the optimizers

(3) try different loss functions from https://keras.io/losses/

(4) repeat many experiments for different permutations of (1),(2) & (3)

(5) for each permutation, explain which ones work and which ones donâ€™t, explain why 


after you finish, make another MLP to classify CIFAR10 data set
repeat (1) to (5)
